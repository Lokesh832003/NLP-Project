Nepali - 
has to use specific encoding
unrealiable for smaller texts because it can sometimes do no summarization at all, if text is small
takes a lot of time to read the original text due to all the extra characters

Telugu - 
Same as Nepali but more problems
Does not work with re.split() function since it gives empty string for some reason
Need to add stopwords manually
has some encoding issues ('\u200c' for a few characters)
