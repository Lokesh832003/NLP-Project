Nepali - 
has to use specific encoding
unrealiable for smaller texts because it can sometimes do no summarization at all, if text is small

Telugu - 
Same as Nepali but more problems
Can't split with '.' because apparently all characters have "." and splitting gives a list of empty strings with len = len of all characters
Can't split with '?' either because python thinks we are trying to split using NULL
(error: nothing to repeat at position 0)
Need to add stopwords manually
has some encoding issues ('\u200c' for a few characters)
